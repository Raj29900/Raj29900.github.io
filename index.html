    <h2>Industrial Engineer</h2>
    <p class="hero-sub">
      I’m an Industrial Engineering graduate with a strong blend of sustainability analytics and mechanical systems experience, especially around emission reduction and fleet sustainability. I’ve worked on evaluating vehicle electrification trends, assessing logistics policies that support low-emission fleet adoption, and using data to uncover practical ways to make operations more sustainable. I enjoy improving processes, enhancing production quality, and finding smarter, cleaner solutions—and 
      I’m excited to bring that mindset to a team that’s focused on impactful, forward-thinking work.
