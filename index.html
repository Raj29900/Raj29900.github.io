    <h2>Research Intern</h2>
    <p class="hero-sub">
      I’m an Industrial Engineering graduate with a strong blend of sustainability analytics and mechanical systems experience, especially around emission reduction and fleet sustainability. I’ve worked on evaluating vehicle electrification trends, assessing logistics policies that support low-emission fleet adoption, and using data to uncover practical ways to make operations more sustainable. I enjoy improving processes, enhancing production quality, and finding smarter, cleaner solutions—and 
      I’m excited to bring that mindset to a team that’s focused on impactful, forward-thinking work.

        <p>
         I published a LinkedIn article titled “The Role of Collaborative Robots in Modern Industry,” where I explored how cobots are changing the workplace by enabling safer, 
         more flexible collaboration between humans and automation.I highlighted how cobots support productivity, reduce ergonomic strain, and expand beyond traditional manufacturing into areas like logistics and healthcare, while also emphasizing the importance of designing automation around human comfort and trust.

        <img src="Tally.jpeg" alt="photo" style="width: 500px; height: 400px;">
        <p>
          I published a Linkedin article sharing my real-life encounter with Tally, BJ’s autonomous inventory robot, and how that experience reshaped the way I think about practical automation in retail operations. In the post, I explain how Tally quietly moves through aisles using sensors and 
          cameras to scan shelf availability, detect out-of-stocks, flag misplaced items, and identify pricing mismatches—acting like a “digital set of eyes” that supports associates rather than replacing them.

        <p>
          In my Medium article, I showcased my axial cooling fan 3D CAD assembly designed in SolidWorks as a realistic, product-style component similar to what’s used in electronics cooling and small industrial equipment. Rather than modeling only the blades, I focused on the complete design layout—building a sturdy square-frame housing with a clean circular opening, 
          adding corner mounting features for real installation use, and creating curved, evenly spaced blades to achieve a balanced and aerodynamic look.

          I published a Medium article showcasing my KPR-themed flask design, where I created a clean, product-style 3D CAD model to practice consumer product modeling and visual branding. In this project, I focused on building a realistic, manufacturable flask with accurate proportions, smooth surface transitions, 
          and a balanced cylindrical form that feels stable and comfortable to hold.
