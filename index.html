    <h2>VALIDATION ENGINEER I</h2>
    <p class="hero-sub">
      I’m an Industrial Engineering graduate with a strong blend of sustainability analytics and mechanical systems experience, especially around emission reduction and fleet sustainability. Alongside that, I work as a <strong>Validation Engineer</strong>, where I support GMP-regulated qualification and validation activities—assisting with IQ/OQ/PQ documentation, protocol execution, data review, and ensuring equipment and processes consistently meet quality and compliance requirements. I’ve worked on evaluating vehicle electrification trends, assessing logistics policies that support low-emission fleet adoption, and using data to uncover practical ways to make operations more sustainable. I enjoy improving processes, enhancing production quality, and finding smarter, cleaner solutions—and 
      I’m excited to bring that mindset to a team that’s focused on impactful, forward-thinking work.

        <p>
          I published a research paper titled “Performance Study on Solar Still using Nano Disbanded Phase Change Material (NDPCM)” in Materials Today: Proceedings, where I investigated 
          how integrating NDPCM into a solar still can improve thermal energy storage and stabilize heat release during low-sunlight periods to convert Saline water into Fresh water.

        <p>
         I published a LinkedIn article titled “The Role of Collaborative Robots in Modern Industry,” where I explored how cobots are changing the workplace by enabling safer, 
         more flexible collaboration between humans and automation.I highlighted how cobots support productivity, reduce ergonomic strain, and expand beyond traditional manufacturing into areas like logistics and healthcare, while also emphasizing the importance of designing automation around human comfort and trust.

        <h3>Meet Tally: How BJ’s Autonomous Aisle Robot Quietly Supports People</h3>
        <img src="Linkedin.png" alt="Linkedin" class="logo-img" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;">
        <p>
          I published a Linkedin article sharing my real-life encounter with Tally, BJ’s autonomous inventory robot, and how that experience reshaped the way I think about practical automation in retail operations. In the post, I explain how Tally quietly moves through aisles using sensors and 
          cameras to scan shelf availability, detect out-of-stocks, flag misplaced items, and identify pricing mismatches—acting like a “digital set of eyes” that supports associates rather than replacing them.

        <p>
          In my Medium article, I showcased my axial cooling fan 3D CAD assembly designed in SolidWorks as a realistic, product-style component similar to what’s used in electronics cooling and small industrial equipment. Rather than modeling only the blades, I focused on the complete design layout—building a sturdy square-frame housing with a clean circular opening, 
          adding corner mounting features for real installation use, and creating curved, evenly spaced blades to achieve a balanced and aerodynamic look.

        <p>
          I published a Medium article showcasing my KPR-themed flask design, where I created a clean, product-style 3D CAD model to practice consumer product modeling and visual branding. In this project, I focused on building a realistic, manufacturable flask with accurate proportions, smooth surface transitions, 
          and a balanced cylindrical form that feels stable and comfortable to hold.

        <p>
          I published a Medium article on my 3D CAD project, “Design of a 9V Battery with Custom UB Branding,” where I modeled a realistic 9V battery from scratch with accurate proportions, terminal details, and clean surface finishing. In the write-up, I explain my design approach, how I kept the form manufacturable, and how I integrated the 
          UB logo as a clean branding band to make the concept look product-ready.
